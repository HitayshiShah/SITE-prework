The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   I did not use any other outside sources to complete this.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   Throughout this prework task, I faced many challenges. This was my first time ever interacting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Due to this new experience, I spent a lot of time reading the instructions over and over to try and understand why I implemented the feature the way the instructions told me to. The syntax of these languages were also relatively new to me, therefore, a lot of my errors included typos and such which took time to find. I decided to tackle this by first reading the instructions and understand what it is asking me to do, instead of typing while reading the instructions. This worked well for me and reduced my errors by a lot. The hardest part of this challenge was implementing the logic near the end. Although I thoroughly understand how to approach the logic and what the result should be, it was hard for me to put that into code. I was stuck on how I should start the logic. I decided to look at the segment of code that was provided and learn off of that. I believe a lot of the problems I faced was due to my unfimiliarity with these languages. Now that I have worked with them once, I will continue to develop my skill with it by working on other projects individually.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   Here are some questions I have for web developments: 1. What is a way to test code for website but also for applications? For example, how would I test to see if this code could work on an application instead of website? 2. What is the best way to debug for front end? ex. Is there something similar to debugger in Eclipse and Intellij? 3. Do we always have to have HTML,CSS, and JavaScript when developing something 4. What are some common libraries that could take this project to another level?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   If I had more time to work on this project there are a few more things I would like to add. It would be cool if there could be small hints when the user hovers over the buttons. However, the hints would only appear if the user if stuck for a certain period of time. Another feature, I would want to add is levels to the game. As the player becomes better, they game should also get harder. One harder feature could be the color disappearing so that the user has to rememember placement of the squares and not the color.
